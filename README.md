In the below YouTube video, Matt Parker and Helen Arney discuss playing a superpermutation on church bells. This is only possible if the separation of each symbol is either 6, 7, or 8. This is a simple python script to check what the separation of each of the symbols are for a given superpermutation.

Directions
---

Create a file containing the superpermutation you want to check (examples given) and simply change the file name in the `main` method in `separation.py`. Run this file using `py separation.py` and the results will be printed  to terminal.
